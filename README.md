Second project for the course Design of computer systems - Sorting Algorithm on MIPS64

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to understand the basic principles and challenges of pipelined instruction processing in processors. The project requires the implementation of a sorting algorithm in MIPS64 assembly language to sort a given string of characters based on their ASCII values and output the sorted string using the EduMIPS64 simulator.

### EduMIPS64 Simulator
1. Download the EduMIPS64 simulator from [EduMIPS54](https://edumips.org).
2. Ensure you have Java installed on your system to run the simulator.
3. Run the code.
